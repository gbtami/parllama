  - HTTP timeouts increased from 5s to 10s for better slow connection support
  - Comprehensive retry mechanism implemented for all network requests
  - Configurable retry behavior via UI settings
  - Smart exponential backoff with jitter prevents thundering herd
- **Note**: `block=True` operations are in threaded workers, not UI thread
- **Priority**: COMPLETED

### 6. Code Quality Issues
- **Issue**: Duplicate code and type safety problems
  - `self._batching` initialized twice in `ChatSession.__init__`
  - Excessive use of `Any` type and `# type: ignore` comments
  - Hard-coded values throughout codebase
- **Priority**: MEDIUM

## Low Priority Issues

### 7. Missing Validation
- **Issue**: Input and file operations lack validation
  - No file path validation before operations
  - No file size limits when loading data
  - Missing network availability checks
- **Priority**: LOW

### 8. State Management Inconsistencies
- **Issue**: Flags managed inconsistently
  - `is_busy` and `is_refreshing` have unclear lifecycle
  - No formal state machine for complex operations
- **Priority**: LOW

### 9. Configuration System
- **Issue**: Hard-coded values should be configurable
  - Timer intervals (1 second) repeated in multiple places
  - Theme fallback to "par_dark" is hard-coded
  - First-run message text embedded in code
- **Priority**: LOW

## Questions and Clarifications Needed

### Architecture Questions
1. **Why dual message systems?** 
   - What's the specific reason for having both Textual messages and Par events?
   - Could these be unified for simpler architecture?
   - ANSWER: The dual message systems are intended to separate UI events from application logic. The Textual message system requires that components decent from its base classes. There are numerus systems that are not directly UI related.

2. **Job Queue Design**
   - Why use Python's Queue instead of asyncio.Queue for the job system?
   - Is the threading model intentional or would full async be better?
   - ANSWER: There are many Textual workers set to thread mode because they have long-running operations that would block the UI. The job queue is used to manage these long running operations and to ensure that the UI remains responsive.

3. **Settings vs Secrets Split**
   - What's the exact criteria for what goes in settings.json vs secrets.json?
   - Should provider base URLs be considered sensitive?
   - ANSWER: the secrets.json is managed by secrets manager and it has not been integrated into the project yet, and is not currently being used.

### Implementation Questions
4. **Clipboard Integration**
   - Why catch and ignore clipboard initialization failures silently?
   - Should clipboard be optional or required functionality?
   - ANSWER: The clipboard is optional functionality, and it is not required for the application to function. The clipboard integration is used to copy and paste text between the application and other applications.

5. **Provider Caching**
   - Why 7-day cache expiration for provider models?
   - Should this be configurable per provider?
   - ANSWER: the current default is reasonable but per provider configuration would be a good idea. The 7-day cache expiration is intended to balance performance with the need for up-to-date model information.

6. **Session Encryption**
   - What's the use case for password-protected sessions?
   - Should encryption be available for all data types?
   - ANSWER: Once the secrets manager is integrated, the session encryption will be used to protect sensitive data. The password-protected sessions are intended to provide an additional layer of security for sensitive data.

### Future Features
7. **Commented Code**
   - RAG tab is commented out - is this planned for implementation?
   - Secrets tab also commented - what functionality was intended?
   - ANSWER: Yes RAG and Secrets tabs are planned for future implementation.

8. **Model Quantization**
   - Docker requirement for quantization seems heavy - alternatives?
   - Could this be integrated more seamlessly?
   - ANSWER: Research completed - Ollama now supports native quantization via the `quantize` parameter in the create method. Docker is only required for quantizing custom HuggingFace models that need the ollama/quantize container. The native quantization requires F16 or F32 base models (not already-quantized models).

## Recent Bug Patterns

Based on recent commits, there's a pattern of issues with:
- Configuration loading (fixed in `e1331f0`)
- Input handling crashes (fixed in `9b35994`)
- Model creation crashes (fixed in `3ff8152`)

This suggests the need for:
- More robust input validation
- Better error boundaries around user operations
- Comprehensive testing of edge cases
