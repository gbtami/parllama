# PAR LLAMA - Issues, Bugs, and Questions


## Questions and Clarifications Needed

### Architecture Questions
1. **Why dual message systems?** 
   - What's the specific reason for having both Textual messages and Par events?
   - Could these be unified for simpler architecture?
   - ANSWER: The dual message systems are intended to separate UI events from application logic. The Textual message system requires that components decent from its base classes. There are numerus systems that are not directly UI related.

2. **Job Queue Design**
   - Why use Python's Queue instead of asyncio.Queue for the job system?
   - Is the threading model intentional or would full async be better?
   - ANSWER: There are many Textual workers set to thread mode because they have long-running operations that would block the UI. The job queue is used to manage these long running operations and to ensure that the UI remains responsive.

3. **Settings vs Secrets Split**
   - What's the exact criteria for what goes in settings.json vs secrets.json?
   - Should provider base URLs be considered sensitive?
   - ANSWER: the secrets.json is managed by secrets manager and it has not been integrated into the project yet, and is not currently being used.

### Implementation Questions
4. **Clipboard Integration**
   - Why catch and ignore clipboard initialization failures silently?
   - Should clipboard be optional or required functionality?
   - ANSWER: The clipboard is optional functionality, and it is not required for the application to function. The clipboard integration is used to copy and paste text between the application and other applications.

5. **Provider Caching**
   - Why 7-day cache expiration for provider models?
   - Should this be configurable per provider?
   - ANSWER: the current default is reasonable but per provider configuration would be a good idea. The 7-day cache expiration is intended to balance performance with the need for up-to-date model information.

6. **Session Encryption**
   - What's the use case for password-protected sessions?
   - Should encryption be available for all data types?
   - ANSWER: Once the secrets manager is integrated, the session encryption will be used to protect sensitive data. The password-protected sessions are intended to provide an additional layer of security for sensitive data.

### Future Features
7. **Commented Code**
   - RAG tab is commented out - is this planned for implementation?
   - Secrets tab also commented - what functionality was intended?
   - ANSWER: Yes RAG and Secrets tabs are planned for future implementation.

8. **Model Quantization**
   - Docker requirement for quantization seems heavy - alternatives?
   - Could this be integrated more seamlessly?
   - ANSWER: Research completed - Ollama now supports native quantization via the `quantize` parameter in the create method. Docker is only required for quantizing custom HuggingFace models that need the ollama/quantize container. The native quantization requires F16 or F32 base models (not already-quantized models).


## Secrets Manager Security Review

### ~~Critical Security Vulnerabilities~~ ✓ FIXED

  - Password changes securely clear old keys before setting new ones
- **Priority**: COMPLETED

#### 7. ~~Salt Regeneration Bug~~ ✓ FIXED
- **File**: `src/parllama/secrets_manager.py:292`
- **Issue**: `clear()` method regenerates salt but doesn't handle existing secrets properly
- **Risk**: Data corruption if vault contains secrets when cleared
- **Fix**: ✅ Enhanced `clear()` method with proper cleanup sequence
  - Securely clears all existing secrets from memory before regenerating salt
  - Clears existing keys and encrypted passwords
  - Proper state management ensures vault is in clean state
- **Priority**: COMPLETED

#### 8. ~~Inconsistent Error Handling~~ ✓ FIXED
- **File**: `src/parllama/secrets_manager.py` (multiple methods)

#### Technical Implementation
```python
@on(LocalModelPulled)
def on_model_pulled(self, event: LocalModelPulled) -> None:
    """Model pulled event"""
    if event.success:
        self.status_notify(f"Model {event.model_name} pulled.")
        # Auto-refresh local model list after successful pull
        self.set_timer(settings.model_refresh_timer_interval, self.action_refresh_models)
    else:
        self.status_notify(f"Model {event.model_name} failed to pull.", severity="error")
```

#### Benefits
